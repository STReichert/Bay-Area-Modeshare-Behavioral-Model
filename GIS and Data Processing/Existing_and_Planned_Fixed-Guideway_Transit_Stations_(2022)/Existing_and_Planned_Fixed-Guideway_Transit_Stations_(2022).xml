            <abstract>The Existing and Planned Fixed-Guideways Transit Stations layer was used to create the one half-mile Transit-Oriented Communities (TOC) Policy Areas (2022) (MTC Res. No. 4530) and is a derivative of the Transit Stops - Existing and Planned (2021) data set. The stops data were filtered to only include stops served by rail, bus rapid transit, tram, streetcar, light rail, cable tram, or ferry stops. These transit route types were classified as 'fixed guideway' transit types following the Transit Oriented Communities policy guidelines.  Additionally, the data set was processed to remove bi-directional stop locations, using geometric proximity to determine the relationship between stops, with the result being a single location for access to transit service. These updated transit access points were named stations, and in many cases, they are served by multiple transit operators. Stations are categorized by the level of transit service, or Transit Service Tier. More information about the TOC Policy, including the full text of Res. No. 4530, can be found here: https://mtc.ca.gov/planning/land-use/transit-oriented-communities-toc-policy. Process and technical documentation can be found on github here: https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/Spatial-Analysis-Mapping-Projects/tree/master/Project-Documentation/Transit-Oriented-Communities.</abstract>
            <purpose>This layer was used to create the half-mile Transit-Oriented Communities (TOC) Policy (MTC Res. No. 4530), which apply to locations within one half-mile of existing and planned transit stops and stations served by rail, light-rail, bus rapid transit, or ferries.</purpose>
